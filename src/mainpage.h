   \author  Toby Burnett


  This package has classes implemeting a simple, fast point-source likelihood, 
  class PointSourceLikelihood.

  The model it implements is a PSF (see PsfFunction for the definition of the GLAST standard power-law function)
  plus a uniform background.

  It works on healpix map of photon data, defined in map_tools::PhotonMap, created from a fits file or list of fits files, see the class Data

  An application pointfit shows its use.
